# Delphi_Canvas
## GDI32 Delphi-Classes TCanvas, TBrush, TPen, TFont in an ActiveX.dll for VB  
from 1997 to 1999 Delphi 3 was my IDE of choice, but at the end of 1999 I got a Job as Visual Basic-Developer.
Coming from Delphi, I was used to the very handsome Delphi-GDI-Classes TCanvas etc.
I wanted this in VB to be more free, so I ported the Delphi classes to VB.
Project started in june 2000
